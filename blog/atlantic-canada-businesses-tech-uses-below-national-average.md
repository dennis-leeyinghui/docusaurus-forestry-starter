It is undeniable that technology enhances work efficiency and brings better business performance. 

A [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/connected-small-businesses.html "Deloitte")'s report suggests that "digitally advanced small businesses" can have these significant benefits:

* 2x higher revenue per employee
* 4x revenue growth
* 6x average employment growth rate

In Atlantic Canada,  the uses of digital tools lag behind the national average, which could further restricts the growth of the region and widen the income gaps between Atlantic Canada and other provinces with more high-tech tools.

The study published by [Atlantic Provinces Economic Council](https://www.apec-econ.ca/) in Mar 2021 shows that only one-third of small businesses in Atlantic Canada uses "any advanced/emerging technology", which is 9 percentage points below the national average. 

Artificial intelligence, internet of things, and cybersecurity technologies are also underutilized, with less than 10% of small businesses include them into their operation.

It's interesting to learn about the reasons behind the low technology use. Uncertainty and risk (22%) and financing (20%) are the primary causes. Small businesses may not feel secure about the future, or be convinced about the advantages of new technologies, as they could prefer their  own personal "experientially proven" ways of doing.

Three key inspirations from the research:

1. More financial assistance should be provided to SMBs to encourage them to try new technologies in their businesses.
2. More Atlantic Canada-focused case studies would help small business owners to build up their confidence in new technologies.
3.  Provide more free trainings to small businesses to guide them on the journey of digital transformation.
